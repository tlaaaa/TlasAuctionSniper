    1.0.8 ~~bot auto starts~~ removed and made it optional since it broke the bot
    1.1 pet rework!!!
    1.1.1 file accessor runs harder, flips sent faster, bot autostart works now (i think), ram optimization a bit hopefully
    1.1.2 optimized even harder (with timestamps on things now)
    1.1.3 optimized a bit harder
    1.1.4 tried to optimize a bit more, probably no change
    1.1.5 changed to an edu project lol x2 speed or something, also fixed some times
    <> not really an update but connected to github
    1.2 removed super, allowed more types of flips in f1. This makes the bot faster, means that you need to check less channels.
    1.3 removed pet flippers and code, fixed up some things with the code. should be faster, and nicer
