    1.0.1 Added recom text
    1.0.2 recom text changed to up arrow
    1.0.3 ofa indicator
    1.0.4 Added newer reforges to normal sniper ignore list (tool and equipment)
    1.0.5 Removed the VIEW AUCTION at the start of everything cause its just not needed
    1.0.6 ignores crab hat colours
    1.0.7 IGNORES BLACKSMITH REFORGES AND BAD REFORGE STONES, THEY ARE ALL TREATED AS CLEAN <actual massive change>
    1.0.8 ~~bot auto starts~~ removed and made it optional since it broke the bot
    1.1 pet rework!!!
    1.1.1 file accessor runs harder, flips sent faster, bot autostart works now (i think), ram optimization a bit hopefully
    1.1.2 optimized even harder (with timestamps on things now)
    1.1.3 optimized a bit harder
    1.1.4 tried to optimize a bit more, probably no change
    1.1.5 changed to an edu project lol x2 speed or something, also fixed some times
    <> not really an update but connected to github
    1.2 removed super, allowed more types of flips in f1. This makes the bot faster, means that you need to check less channels.
    1.3 removed pet flippers and code (its just part of the other flip channels), fixed up some things with the code. should be faster, and nicer
    1.3.1 Indicators for some more enchants (se5, l5, ov5 etc)
    1.4 !!! Shows clean prices on items, rarity indicator changed to an emote instead of the longer text! Lowest BIN -> LBIN
    1.4.1 bug fixes and added master stars to clean calculation
    1.5 much faster, flip calculations happen in about 0.15 seconds so thats kinda op. might be a little more inaccurate but yeah
    1.6 Pushed changes from mod (1-4 star treated as 0, fabled/sus/withered treated as the same, shows reforge)
    1.7 gemstone slots
